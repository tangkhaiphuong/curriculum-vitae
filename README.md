### Project Description
This is a ported version of p3scan open source into C++ language with many enhanced features which are not supported or limited by p3scan. The application has been re-designed in object-oriented ways, more robust, POCO framework based. The socket implementation inherits the Boost Asio library which is epoll() based, supports thread-pool, SSL, and cross-platform.
The application is able to simultaneously listen on different ports (different protocol). Currently, the application supports POP3, IMAP, and SMTP protocol, but with the loose-coupled design, each implemented protocol is isolated from the server, so it is easy to integrate more protocols without modifying the current implementation.

### Project: Product Barcode Validation System
### Project Description
This software in combination with the PLC devices provides a manufacturing solution for P&G in terms of production control, production and productivity reporting, product failure tracking…
The main purpose is to verify and control the product’s barcode during the packing process.
The system monitors the products’ barcodes on the packing line in a real-time manner, validates the products’ code and rejects the invalid product’s barcode. All these activities are controlled under the Barcode software which allows operators to:
Real-time monitoring the product in different production lines.
Make report of bad, wrong, or good product’s barcode.
The system architecture is the client-server model. The server is responsible for collecting real-time data information from packing lines and managing product’s barcode. The client (workstation) is used by operators to input products’ barcode, monitor the packing line status and make reports.
